## How Betting Works

Poly-Predict uses virtual credits — no real money is involved. Every new user starts with **10,000 credits**.

### Step by Step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browse events">
    Visit the homepage or the events page to see open prediction markets. Filter by category, search by keyword, or sort by volume.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select an event">
    Click on any event to see its details: the question, current odds for each outcome, price history chart, and volume stats.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose an outcome">
    Pick **Yes** or **No** (or whichever outcomes the event offers). The current odds are displayed next to each option.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your bet amount">
    Type the number of credits you want to wager. The potential payout is calculated and shown before you confirm.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm">
    Submit your bet. Your credits are immediately deducted from your available balance and moved to your frozen balance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Odds and Payout

Odds are sourced from Polymarket and represent the market's probability for each outcome. They are **locked at the time you place your bet** — subsequent price changes don't affect existing bets.

The payout formula:

```
potential_payout = amount / locked_odds
```

**Example:** You bet 100 credits on "Yes" at odds 0.40 (40% probability).

- `potential_payout = 100 / 0.40 = 250 credits`
- If you win, you receive 250 credits (150 profit)
- If you lose, you lose your 100 credits

<Note>
  Lower odds (closer to 0) mean higher potential payouts but lower probability. Higher odds (closer to 1) mean lower payouts but higher probability.
</Note>

## Bet Statuses

| Status      | Meaning                                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pending`   | Event is still open — bet is active                      |
| `won`       | Event resolved in your favor — payout credited           |
| `lost`      | Event resolved against your pick — credits forfeited     |
| `cancelled` | Bet was cancelled (e.g. event removed before resolution) |

## Balance Types

- **Available balance** — Credits you can use to place new bets
- **Frozen balance** — Credits locked in active (pending) bets

When you place a bet, credits move from available to frozen. When a bet settles:
- **Win:** frozen credits are released and the full payout is added to your available balance
- **Loss:** frozen credits are removed from your account
