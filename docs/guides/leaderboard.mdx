## Ranking Periods

The leaderboard supports three time periods:

| Period      | Window              | Description                        |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **All Time** | Since account creation | Lifetime performance               |
| **Weekly**  | Last 7 days         | Rolling week performance           |
| **Monthly** | Last 30 days        | Rolling month performance          |

Switch between periods using the tabs on the leaderboard page.

## Ranking Metrics

You can sort the leaderboard by any of these metrics:

| Metric          | Formula                                      | Description                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Total Profit** | Sum of all payout gains minus losses          | Net credits earned from betting       |
| **Win Rate**    | `win_count / (win_count + loss_count)`        | Percentage of bets won (0.0 to 1.0)  |
| **ROI**         | `total_profit / total_amount_wagered`         | Return on investment as a decimal     |

Additional stats displayed per player:

- **Total Assets** — Available balance + frozen balance
- **Win/Loss Count** — Number of winning and losing bets
- **Consecutive Wins** — Current win streak

## How Rankings Update

Rankings are **recalculated after each settlement cycle**. When the settler service resolves an event:

1. All bets on that event are settled (won/lost)
2. User stats are updated (profit, win count, streaks)
3. Rankings are recomputed for all affected users across all three periods

This means the leaderboard reflects the latest settled results, not real-time odds changes.

<Note>
  Only settled bets count toward rankings. Pending bets do not affect your leaderboard position.
</Note>

## Category Rankings

Rankings can also be filtered by **event category** (e.g., Politics, Sports, Crypto). This lets you see who performs best in specific domains.

Pass the `category` query parameter to the rankings API, or use the category filter on the leaderboard page.
