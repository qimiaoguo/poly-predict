## Access

The admin panel runs at [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in development. Log in with your admin credentials (email + password). Admin accounts are stored in the `admin_users` table with bcrypt-hashed passwords.

## Dashboard

The dashboard provides a quick overview of platform health:

- **Total Users** — Number of registered users
- **Total Bets** — Total bets placed across all events
- **Active Events** — Number of currently open events
- **Total Volume** — Aggregate betting volume
- **Recent Bets** — Latest bets placed on the platform

## Events Management

Browse all events with filters for status (`open`, `closed`, `resolved`) and category. From here you can:

- **View event details** — See the question, outcomes, odds, and volume
- **Update an event** — Change the category or status
- **Force settle** — Manually resolve an event by specifying the winning outcome

### Force Settlement

If an event needs to be resolved before the automatic settler picks it up:

1. Navigate to the event
2. Click "Settle"
3. Select the winning outcome
4. Confirm

This triggers the same settlement logic as the automatic settler — all bets are processed, payouts distributed, and rankings updated.

<Warning>
  Force settlement is irreversible. Double-check the winning outcome before confirming.
</Warning>

## User Management

View all platform users with search and sorting options. For each user you can:

- **View profile** — See balance, stats, recent bets, and account details
- **Adjust balance** — Add or subtract credits from a user's account
- **Ban/unban** — Disable or re-enable a user's account

### Balance Adjustments

Send a `PATCH` request to adjust a user's balance:
- **Positive value** — Adds credits (e.g., compensation, bonus)
- **Negative value** — Removes credits (e.g., correction)

All balance adjustments are logged as credit transactions for audit purposes.

## Settlements History

View a chronological log of all event settlements, including:

- Which event was settled
- The resolved outcome
- Number of bets affected
- Total credits paid out
- Settlement timestamp
